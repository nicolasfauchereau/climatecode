I am a climate scientist (to know more about me, head [here](http://nicolasfauchereau.github.io/climatecode/stories/about-me/)) and have been using
[Python](http://www.python.org) as my main high-level language for data analysis
and visualisation for about 10 years, slowly transitioning from Matlab and R.

In this blog, I will try and share what's I have learned along the way, and give
full examples of how I use Python in my research or operational workflows.

I will occasionally reflect on [open science](http://openscience.com), and how open-source in general,
and Python in particular can be used to help make climate science more open.
