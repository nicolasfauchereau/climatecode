## Who am I ?

Hi ! my name is [Nicolas Fauchereau](mailto:nicolas.fauchereau@gmail.com)
I am a climate scientist at [NIWA](http://www.niwa.co.nz) and I am based in Auckland, New Zealand.

I work on a variety of things, from the reconstruction of the climates of the past
to seasonal forecasting. I have a strong interest in methods (statistics, machine learning particularly),
in scientific computing and open science.

## Where do I come from ?

I hail from Burgundy, France, and I obtained my Ph.D (in 2004) in [Dijon](http://climatologie.u-bourgogne.fr/). After about a year
at the [LSCE](http://www.lsce.ipsl.fr/en/), near Paris, I decided to expand a bit my horizons. I was granted a post-doctoral
fellowship from the [University of Cape-Town](http://www.uct.ac.za/), and I spent about 3 years working at the
[oceanography department](http://www.sea.uct.ac.za/) (where I am still a research associate), notably with
[Prof. Mathieu Rouault](http://ma-re.uct.ac.za/staff/academic-staff/dr-mathieu-rouault/), another french import in South Africa and one of the most
versatile scientists I have known. In 2009 I joined
the [CSIR](http://www.csir.co.za/) as a senior researcher in the Southern Ocean Carbon and Climate Observatory ([SOCCO](http://socco.org.za/about/)) where I had the
great privilege of working with a [bunch of awesome people](http://socco.org.za/about/#team).  

<br>
In 2012 we decided to relocate our little family to New Zealand, and I obtained
a position at the [National Institute for Water and Atmospheric research (NIWA Ltd.)](http://www.niwa.co.nz).  

<br>
Since joining NIWA, I have been working on a variety of projects, and been involved in both
basic research (*e.g.* paleoclimate reconstructions) and very applied science (*e.g.* forecasting climate at sub-seasonal
to seasonal time-scales). A common theme though: all this involves processing and analyzing data - oftentimes a lot of data - and using statistical methods to
try and make sense of this data, extract patterns, and make predictions. Along the years I used various tools, from Matlab to R, but over the past few years I have transitioned completely to **Python**: the [Python Scientific Ecosystem](http://www.scipy.org/about.html) has grown exponentially both in quality and quantity, and now there's almost nothing that you can do in R or Matlab
that you cannot do in Python, and on top of being open-source, [Python is just fun to code](https://xkcd.com/353/).

## Tools

I use [Python](http://www.python.org) and of course the Python Scientific ecosystem,
in particular, this is what I use (almost) daily:

<br>

+ [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
+ [scipy](http://www.scipy.org/)
+ [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
+ [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
+ [basemap](https://basemaptutorial.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
+ [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/)
+ [xray](https://github.com/xray/xray)

and of course the [IPython (now Jupyter)](https://jupyter.org/) notebook.
